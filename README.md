# Speech-recognition-app-in-Indian-languages
The project "Speech to Text in Indian Languages" connects spoken words in several Indian languages - Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali and Marathi, to written text using Google's Speech-to-Text API and Python. 
This ensures effective transcription of indian languages which can have various dialects and pronounciations, this also ensures note taking as it has the option to store the transcribed text in the .txt format.
Thus this app ensures us to reduce the complexity in notetaking of various languages other than english.
